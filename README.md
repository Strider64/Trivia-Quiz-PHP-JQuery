<p style="color:blue;">Added a Login Feature where you don't have to enter player name, increase time per question from 10 seconds to 20 seconds per question if login and increased points per question from 100 to 250 also if login.</p>

<h1 style="color:green;">Added a high scores feature on October 14, 2016</h1>

I am still tackling the login, registration and high scores features of this trivia game. The Login / Registration basically works, but as of right now it doesn't do anything useful. I haven't even begun the touch the high scores feature, but that should be realitively easy to implement. This one thing I liked with working with Flash was how easy it was to do the graphics for the game --- even if it is just simple graphics. Designing the trivia game with HTML and CSS kind of sucks.

I originally wrote this game in Flash Actionscript 3.0 about 5 to 6 years ago and about 2 years ago I started to convert it over to PHP. I eventually added JQuery, Ajax and JSON to the game in order to have more of a dynamic experience. I have future modifications in mind for this trivia game. Some of the modifications is having the ability to add, edit and delete questions/answer directly from a web browser. This will give the system administrator and users the ability to add questions/answers directly to the database's table remotely. I also want to add a high score table and each day have a winner. I'm am thinking that the winner of the day will have the ability to add questions/answers to the quiz giving the incentive to comeback tomorrow to play.
All the current games files and the respective directories can be found at Github. Feel free to use all of the files as is or with modifications, but all I ask is that you give me credit for the game itself. Just inserting the credit inside the code somewhere will be enough for me. Even if you don't use any of the code in your own project I hope this will help you out in the long run.
