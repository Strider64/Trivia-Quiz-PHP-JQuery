# Trivia-Quiz-PHP-JQuery-Game 

To make a long story short I have been writing this trivia game for a little over 5 years now. Not constantly for the game was originally written in Flash Actionscript 3.0 then I ported it over to PHP. I also have taken breaks to learn other things relating to Web development and Graphics Design. The final version is written in PHP, JQuery, Ajax and JSON. It's a simple game that I plan on making additional changes in the future, such as the ability to add, edit and delete questions/answers remotely. This way a system adminstrator or even the users can add questions/answers to the trivia game. This is a fully functional game and you are free to use it as is, modify the code or just get ideas for you own project. All that I ask you to do is give me some credit if you use the code that pertains to the game itself.  I will be adding a few more files to this project soon and I will be upgrading to the the modifications that I already mention in the above paragraph. I you notice any bugs, modifications or improvements that can be made then feel free to share with me and others.
